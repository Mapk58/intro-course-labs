# Task 1: Software Distribution

### Definition and Importance

Software distribution = making software available to users. It involves packaging, delivery, and installation. Saves dev time, improves system security via automated updates tracking.

### Distribution Strategies and Characteristics

1. Physical media (e.g., CDs, DVDs, USB drives): For areas with limited internet and as a backup. Expensive, effortful, fast obsolescence.

2. Online website downloads: Common, but risk of untrusted sources.

3. Platform-specific app stores (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store): Trusted, support updates. Users search, buy, and download software. Devs face strict guidelines.

4. Cloud-based deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP): Deploy apps, resources on cloud platforms. Users obtain computing power, storage, services online.

### Best Practices

1. Documentation and support: Essential docs, multiple support channels.

2. Version control: Regular updates for features and bug fixes.

3. Feedback and analytics: Gather feedback, analyze usage data for system improvement.

4. Automation and continuous delivery: Automate tools, processes for continuous product updates and efficient deployment.

5. Security: Protect software from hacking.
