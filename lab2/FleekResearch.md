## IPFS using fleek

Setting up hosting your own website through the described service felt like “click continue several times to make it cool.” I was surprised by the ease of setup and the very concept of deployment on a decentralized file system. In the future, I will definitely try to deploy one of my services using docker on this system and will use it for hackathons and other projects.

I also drew attention to the possibility of using this protocol via regular HTTP. This greatly simplifies interaction with projects deployed on it and lowers the entry barrier for a potential user.
